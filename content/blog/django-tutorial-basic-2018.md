Ever thought about making a stunning new website in weekend but couldn’t?
> # Ever your project got stuck because you couldn’t handle the server-side work?
> # Ever ran “out of time”?

**I know your answer to all of them is a big YES!**

Well, here comes [Django](https://github.com/django/django) to save us all from those evil happenings.
> Hey, i’ve never heard of any applications using Django, do you really think this can help me?

YES! A lot of big landlords in the Silicon Valley are using Django.
> For example?

Well… [Instagram](http://instagram.com) uses it, [Spotify](http://spotify.com) does too and so does [Disqus](http://disqus.com) which actually is the largest Django project till date.
> This Django sounds fun, professional and profitable, how do i start using it?

## Installation:

It’s as easy as blinking your eye, Take my word for it!

Prerequisites:

* You must have python 3.x.y installed already.

* You must have the latest version of* pip *installed on it.

If you don’t have python already installed you can go [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and for pip [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).
> How to install it?

Just type in ***pip install django ***in the terminal and,** VOILA!**
> Any special recommendations?

I’d recommend you install it in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) instead of installing it system-wide, read more about virtual environments [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## Implementation:

### So now that you have Django installed, let’s make something using it!
> How about a blog post web-app?

Sure, works out for me.

### Creating a project

    **$** django-admin startproject mysite
> Starter files?

```
    mysite/
        manage.py
        mysite/
            __init__.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
```

> What do they mean?

* The outer **mysite/** root directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.

* **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about**manage.py** in [django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/).

* The inner **mysite/** directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. **mysite.urls**).

* **mysite/__init__.py**: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python beginner, read [more about packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages) in the official Python docs.

* **mysite/settings.py**: Settings/configuration for this Django project. [Django settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/settings/) will tell you all about how settings work.

* **mysite/urls.py**: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in [URL dispatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/).

* **mysite/wsgi.py**: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See [How to deploy with WSGI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/) for more details.

### Starting the web server:

Once you’re in the mysite directory, type in command line or terminal.

    $ python manage.py runserver

After you run the command, to check if the server is running go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) from your desired browser, it should look something like this.

## Making the blog app

We will use Django models for saving every blog post, a Django model is basically an Object with has it’s own attributes and functions and for a blog we should be needing attributes such as: Title, Body, Header, Footer, Author, Date created, Date published. and a save() function.

To create an app under the project mysite use:

	$ python manage.py startapp blog

After creating an application, we also need to tell Django that it should use it. We do that by specifying in the file mysite/settings.py. We need to find INSTALLED_APPS and add a line containing 'blog', just above ]. So the final product should look somehting like this:

```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        ...
        'blog',
    ]
```

the models.py is the file in which we define all our models, let’s define a Post model here.

```
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.db import models
    from django.utils import timezone
    
    
    class Post(models.Model):
        author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
        text = models.TextField()
        created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
        published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
    
        def publish(self):
            self.published_date = timezone.now()
            self.save()
    
        def __str__(self):
            return self.title
```

Let’s add model to the database

    $ python manage.py makemigrations blog

then apply the migration file to the database

    $ python manage.py migrate blog
> How do i add new posts now?

We use Django admin for that, let’s set it up.

edit your admin.py file to this

```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Post
    
    admin.site.register(Post)
```

Run the server using python manage.py runserver and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) from your browser.

You should see something like this.

To log in here, you’d need a superuser which has all the permissions on a Django server, let’s create one.

### Django superuser

Create a superuser using python manage.py createsuperuser , now when prompted put in the details and use those details to log in.

After logging in you should see something like this
